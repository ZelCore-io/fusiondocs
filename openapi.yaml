      summary: Fees tied with using Fusion services
      description: 'Apart from its main chain, Flux is present also as a token on multiple other chains. Doing on chain transactions comes with a cost of using gas - native coin on those chains. Fusion is charging those fees from end user to remain sustainable in the form of sending less Flux than is user allowance. Each section has its flat fee, additionally a percentage fee may be applied.'

        Reservation of swap is highly recommended for every Swap you want to make. You should tell Fusion that some incoming swap including particular chains and addresses will be happening. This step will trigger additional checks on the actual swap creation. Apart from body request, it is also recommended to send zelid header as another security measure and for order history tracking.
